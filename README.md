AGL (A good language) is my first attempt at fully implementing a language, I alreayd have most of the design laid out. It will be implemented using LLVM and C/C++

The goal of this language is to have a superset of C like C++ etc, but one that is still easily knowable. With modern syntax, and features to maximize readablity and ease of use. Its syntax largely takes inspiration from Kotlin, Swift, Python, C, C++, and Rust.

The end goal is to also make a dependancy management/build tool inspired by cargo which will work with both C and AGL.

I will post example syntax shortly
